The next step is to design and implement a project-based bucket structure in MinIO, aligning with best practices for object storage organization. This will involve creating separate buckets for each project or using project-specific prefixes within buckets to logically separate assets, ensuring scalability and easier access control. The implementation should leverage MinIO's support for nested prefixes and bucket-level management, as well as consider enabling versioning and appropriate retention policies for asset management.\n</info added on 2025-06-16T16:28:17.514Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-16T16:30:08.672Z>\nImplementation progress:\n- Enhanced MinIO utilities to support project-based organization, introducing dual bucket support for private (bitrealm-assets) and public (bitrealm-public) assets.\n- Implemented hierarchical object paths using the format projects/{projectId}/{assetType}/{filename} to ensure logical separation and scalability.\n- Added CDN support with appropriate cache headers for optimized asset delivery.\n- Maintained backward compatibility with deprecated warnings for legacy integrations.\n- Configured lifecycle rules for temporary uploads to automate cleanup.\n- Developed helper functions for asset copying and thumbnail generation.\n\nKey features implemented:\n1. getBucketName() determines the appropriate bucket based on asset visibility.\n2. getObjectPath() constructs organized, hierarchical object paths.\n3. uploadProjectAsset() handles uploads within the project context.\n4. getProjectAssetUrl() generates asset URLs with CDN integration.\n5. listProjectAssets() provides paginated asset listings.\n\nNext step: Update server/index.js to invoke initializeBuckets() during startup to ensure all required buckets are created and configured.\n</info added on 2025-06-16T16:30:08.672Z>",

An AJV-based asset validation system was created in server/utils/assetValidator.js, which loads and compiles sprite-sheet and tileset JSON schemas, extracts metadata from uploads, validates them, and provides clear error messages for any validation failures. The asset upload API now integrates this validation, verifies project ownership, supports public/private assets via an isPublic flag, uses new project-based MinIO functions, stores validated metadata in the database, and organizes thumbnails appropriately. A new GET /api/assets/project/:projectId endpoint allows fetching project assets, combining project-specific assets from MinIO with asset pack defaults, enforcing access control based on project ownership or collaboration, and supporting pagination for large collections. The validation flow ensures that uploaded files have their metadata extracted and validated against JSON schemas, returning detailed errors if validation fails and storing validated metadata for runtime use.
